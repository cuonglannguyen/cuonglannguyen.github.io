I'm Lan-Cuong Nguyen, an AI researcher at FPT Software AI Center. Before joing the FPT AI Residency Program, I received my Bachelor's Degree from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST). I'm advised by Prof. [Dung D.Le](https://andrew-dungle.github.io) from VinUniversity. I have also worked closely with Prof. [Khoat Than](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/khoattq/) from HUST and Prof. [Long Tran-Thanh](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/long_tran-thanh/) from University of Warwick since my undergrad years. I also had wonderful opportunities to collaborate with Prof. [Hongkai Wen](https://hongkaiw.github.io/) from University of Warwick and Dr.[Katie Luo](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~katieluo/) from Stanford University through my projects.

My research focuses on Data-centric AI, Multimodal AI, and Trustworthy AI. My research questions centers around how to make data more efficient, helpful, and reliable for AI models.
