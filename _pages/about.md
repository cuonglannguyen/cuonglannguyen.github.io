I'm Lan-Cuong Nguyen, an AI Research Resident at FPT Software AI Center. Before joing the FPT AI Residency Program, I received my Bachelor's Degree from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST). I'm advised by Prof. [Dung D.Le](https://andrew-dungle.github.io) from VinUniversity. I have also worked closely with Prof. [Khoat Than](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/khoattq/) from HUST and Prof. [Long Tran-Thanh](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/long_tran-thanh/) from University of Warwick since my undergrad years. I also had wonderful opportunities to being advised by Prof. [Hongkai Wen](https://hongkaiw.github.io/) from University of Warwick and Dr. [Katie Luo](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~katieluo/) from Stanford University in my different projects.

My research focuses on Data-centric AI, Multimodal AI, and Trustworthy AI. My research questions center around how to make data more efficient, helpful, and reliable for AI models. More specifically, my research have focused on how to enhance the performance of vision language models under extreme data condition, such as data scarcity and data poisoning. I also have experience and open to collaboration opportunities in other data-related tasks, such as data curation, data selection, and data distillation.

I'm actively looking for PhD position starting from Fall 2026.
